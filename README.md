# Milestone Project One: Samurai
------
This is my 1st milestone project for my Code Institute Diploma in Software Development. 
The aim for this right now is to create a static site promoting a band called **Samurai**.
The band is from the game **Cyberpunk 2077** by the developers *CD Projekt Red*, and the site is largely designed around the band's theme.
## UX
------
### User Stories:
* I am an avid listener of **Samurai**, I'm looking for tour dates so that I can go to one of their shows.
* I have heard about the band **Samurai** and have heard some of their music, but am looking to learn more about the band itself.
* I have never heard a **Samurai** song before, I am looking to listen to one of their songs to get a feel for their music.
* I am an employee of a record label, I am looking for a contact page so that we can talk about signing them to our label.

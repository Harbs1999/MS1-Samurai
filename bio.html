                <strong>Johnny Silverhand</strong>born as Robert John Linder in November 16, 1988, is the lead singer of Samurai.
                Johnny is mostly known to be charming and charismatic, but is prone to bouts of anger, irrationalism and
                impulsiveness, which suit his rockerboy personality perfectly.

                <strong>Kerry Eurodyne</strong>born April 20, 1988, is the vocalist and lead guitarist for Samurai. Kerry, whilst still
                living the rockerboy lifestyle, is much more laidback compared to his best friend, Johnny Silverhand.
                Although
                Kerry has had a rocky past with Samurai, he is perhaps the most talented musician of the group and
                definitely the most devoted to his career.

                <strong>Nancy Hartley</strong>born July 18, 1985, is the keyboardist for Samurai. Nancy's dont-give-a-damn attitude has
                won the hearts of many of Samurai's fans. Nancy and Silverhand have been known to be involved with each
                other on and off, but most of their relationship is kept a secret from the public.

                <strong>Denny</strong>Unlike most drummers in bands, does not enjoy being in the spotlight very much. This means that
                not much is known of denny, except that she is married to fellow band member Henry.

                <strong>Henry</strong> Is the bassist for Samurai and like his paramour, Denny, does not enjoy having the attention on
                him, despite his loud, harsh demeanor. He has however been known to get into fights with his other
                bandmates, both physical and verbal.
